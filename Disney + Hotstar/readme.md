## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

This command runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser to view it.

The page will reload if you make edits, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more information about running tests, refer to the [Create React App documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

This command builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include hashes. Your app will be ready for deployment after this step.

For more information about deployment, check out the [deployment section](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) in the Create React App documentation.

### `npm run eject`
